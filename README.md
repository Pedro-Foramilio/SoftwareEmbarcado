## General Behavior:

This embedded software application is designed to manage and display internal and external values on a 7-segment display. The application operates in different modes, displaying either two internal values (CRON and ADC) or both internal and external values, depending on user interactions and received requests. Full specifications are available on PDF file on this github repository.

### Key Components:
1. **Internal Values:**
   - **CRON:** A chronometer value.
   - **ADC:** An analog-to-digital converter value.

2. **External Values:**
   - **External CRON:** Received via UART.
   - **External ADC:** Received via UART.

3. **Harware Devices:**
    - **LEDs**: 4 LEDs to indicate which value is being displayed.
    - **UART**: An UART to handle communication between devices.
    - **ADC**
    - **7-segment display**

### Mode Switching:
The application switches between different display modes based on:
- **User Button Presses:** Physical buttons connected to GPIO pins trigger interrupts that change the display mode.
- **Received Requests:** UART communication allows the application to receive external values and requests, influencing the display mode.

### Display Modes:
1. **STARTUP:** Initial mode where all LEDs are turned on.
2. **WFI (Wait For Interrupt):** All LEDs are turned on, waiting for an interrupt while displaying RA.
3. **LED_CRON:** Toggles LED1 and displays the internal CRON value.
4. **LED_ADC:** Toggles LED2 and displays the internal ADC value.
5. **LED_CRON_EXT:** Toggles LED3 and displays the external CRON value.
6. **LED_ADC_EXT:** Toggles LED4 and displays the external ADC value.

### Behavior:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The `StartDefaultTask` function initializes peripherals and starts the default task, which includes setting up UART reception and resetting LEDs.

2. **LED Management:**
   - The `MngLED` task manages the state of LEDs based on the current mode (`modoLed`). It operates in an task, switching LED states and delaying for a predefined time (`DT_LEDS`).

3. **Display Management:**
   - The `fn_Task_Varrer` function updates the display based on the current LED mode. It handles the display of internal and external values and ensures the correct decimal point position. Each time it needs to display an external value, it puts a request code into the queue.

4. **Communication Management:**
   - The `fn_Task_MngComns` function manages UART communication, handling requests from a queue and transmitting data. It processes messages to send appropriate data over UART.

5. **Button Press Handling:**
   - The `EXTI1_IRQHandler`, `EXTI2_IRQHandler`, and `EXTI3_IRQHandler` functions handle external interrupts for button presses. They debounce the button presses and update the system state, sending requests or changing display modes as needed.

6. **UART Callback Function:**
    - The `HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback` function is responsible for receiving external values and managing mode trasnsition whenever a request for service is received (or end of service).

### Summary:

The application continuously monitors button presses and UART communication to update the display with the appropriate values. It ensures smooth transitions between different display modes, providing real-time updates of internal and external values on the 7-segment display.

## StartDefaultTask
### Description
The `StartDefaultTask` function is the default task in the system. It initializes certain peripherals and enters an infinite loop.

### Parameters
- `argument`: A pointer to the argument passed to the task (not used in this function).

### Behavior
1. Records the start time using `HAL_GetTick()`.
2. Resets the state of LEDs connected to GPIO pins `LED1`, `LED2`, `LED3`, and `LED4` on port `GPIOB`.
3. Initiates an interrupt-based UART receive operation using `HAL_UART_Receive_IT`.
4. Enters an infinite loop with a delay of 1 ms in each iteration.

### Expected Side-effects
1. Responsible for the initial display of LEDs on the 7-seg display for 2 seconds. This side-effect is manifested in a later mentioned task

## MngLED

### Description
The LED control task manages the state of LEDs connected to GPIO pins on port `GPIOB`. It operates in an infinite loop and changes the LED states based on the current mode (`modoLed`).

### Modes

- `WFI`: Turns on all LEDs.
- `LED_CRON`: Toggles `LED1` and turns off `LED2`, `LED3`, and `LED4`.
- `LED_ADC`: Toggles `LED2` and turns off `LED1`, `LED3`, and `LED4`.
- `LED_CRON_EXT`: Toggles `LED3` and turns off `LED1`, `LED2`, and `LED4`.

## TaskDisplay

### Description
The `fn_TaskDisplay` function is responsible for managing the display mode and updating the LED mode accordingly. It operates in an infinite loop and changes the LED mode based on the current display mode (`modoDisplay`). In short, the function of this task is to change the (`modoDisplay`) variable to provides the appropriate sequence of values to display on screen.

### Parameters
- `argument`: A pointer to the argument passed to the task (not used in this function).

### Display Modes
- `WFI`: No action is taken.
- `DISPLAY_INTRN`: Toggles between `LED_CRON` and `LED_ADC` modes.
- `DISPLAY_EXTRN`: Cycles through `LED_CRON_EXT`, `LED_ADC`, `LED_CRON_EXT`, `LED_ADC_EXT`, and `WFI` modes based on the current LED mode and the state of `A1_foi_apertado`. 
    - If `A1_foi_apertado == 0` then only the external values are displayed, and the RA is displayed in place of the internal values.
    - If `A1_foi_apertado == 1` then the task cycles through all the values, ignoring RA.

### Behavior
1. Enters an infinite loop.
2. Switches the LED mode based on the current display mode (`modoDisplay`).
3. Delays for a predefined time (`DT_DISPLAY_MD1` or `DT_DISPLAY_MD2`) before the next iteration.

### Expected Side-effects
1. Besides the use of (`modoDisplay`) by the task MngLED to determine which LED to toggle on and off, this variable is also used on a later specified task to determine which value to display on the 7-seg display.

## HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback - Callback Function

### Description
The `HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback` function is a UART receive complete callback. It processes incoming UART data and updates the system state based on the received messages.

### Parameters
- `huart`: A pointer to the `UART_HandleTypeDef` structure that contains the configuration information for the specified UART module.

### Behavior
1. Disables interrupts to ensure atomic operations.
2. Checks the first character of the received buffer (`BufIN`) to determine the type of message received and performs the corresponding actions:
   - `'s'`: Resets all LEDs, sets `modoDisplay` to `DISPLAY_EXTRN`, and updates `modoLed` based on the state of `A1_foi_apertado` to decide whether to show internal values or not.
   - `'n'`: Resets all LEDs, sets `modoDisplay` to `DISPLAY_INTRN`, and updates `modoLed` based on the state of `A1_foi_apertado` to decide whether to enter the state `waiting for intput` or not. It's purpose is to signal that external values must not be displayed anymore.
   - `'A'`: External ADC value recieved. Converts the next four characters to numeric values and stores them in `ValAdcExt`.
   - `'T'`: External CRON value recieved. Converts the next four characters to numeric values and stores them in `CronoExt`.
   - `'t'`: Puts a `Q_SND_CRN` message in the queue to signal the need to send a cron value update.
   - `'a'`: Puts a `Q_SND_ADC` message in the queue to signal the need to send a adc value update.
3. Re-enables interrupts.
4. Re-initiates UART reception in interrupt mode to continuously listen for incoming data.

2. If the debounce period has elapsed:
   - Updates the timestamp of the last interrupt (`tIN_IRQ1`).
